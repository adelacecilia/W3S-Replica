    <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
      <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
    <p>The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a
    new line and take up the full width available 
    (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>This is an inline span 
    <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span>
    element inside a paragraph.</p>
    <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start 
    on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

    <h2>The div Element</h2>
      <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London is the capital city of England.
      It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a
      metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
      <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major 
      settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its 
      founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
