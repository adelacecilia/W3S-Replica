    <p>A computer program can easily produce gibberish 
    especially if it has been provided with garbage 
    beforehand. This program does something a little 
    different. It takes a block of text as input and 
    works out the proportion of characters within the 
    text according to a chosen order. </p>
    <p>For example, an order of 2 means the program 
    looks at pairs of letters, an order of 3 means 
    triplets of letters and so on. 
    The software can regurgitate random text that is 
    controlled by the proportion of characters. 
    The results can be quite surprising.</p>
    <p>0 order produces random text based on the 
    proportion of letters within the input text, 
    2nd order produces gibberish
    6th order and above can often be meaninglessly 
    readable.</p>
